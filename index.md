# Welcome to Mutation

### Summary

You are Brad Luck, the most unlucky guy in the universe. In fact, the universe is trying to kill you. Always chasing you down with somthing deadly that you have to escape. 

Travel through 5 deadly levels, using powerful mutations that have infected you along the way (how unlucky!). To find the fifth level, you must first conquer the first 4, finding the map piece on each world. Careful not to get killed!

This project was created as one of my game development classes. It is a side-scrolling platform chase game, and it's quite challenging!

### Try it out!

There is an executable in the [root folder](https://github.com/AidanFairman/Mutation/) of this project.  

### Contribution

My main contribution to the project was to figure out how to do the trickier parts that the other group members couldn't figure out. I figured out how to do control-remapping with GameMaker, came up with a way to save and load, killed some of our big bugs, and a couple other things I have forgotten at this time. If we needed it for the game and there was no obvious way to make it work, it was my project to get it in there.
